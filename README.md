Travellers Club is a blog about travel tips in general, destinations, photo and videos. It was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React as a Single page application. Responsive, mobile first workflow.
Travellers Club was built based on ![Band of Travellers](https://www.bandoftravellers.com/), very identical but with some differences. 

The goal with this project was to put my knowledge in frontend web development so far in practice, with a big focus in the use of the React library.
